# Publish Post

The **Publish Post** script is used to publish videos or images on TikTok.

## Steps

1. **Prepare materials**:
   - Option 1: Click the `Media Library` button to upload videos/images to the media library.
   - Option 2: Use a local folder as the material source and set the folder path in the script configuration.
2. Select the devices on which you want to run the script.
3. Click `Scripts` > `Publish Post`.
4. Configure task settings:
    - **Material Source**: Choose Media Library or Local Folder.
    - **Local Folder Path**: If using a local folder, specify the path containing videos/images.
    - **Posting Method**: Choose how to post: System Share, Add Button (`+`), or “Use Sound via Search”.
    - **Sound Name**: When using “Use Sound via Search”, you can:
      - Enter a sound name to search (e.g., “original sound”, “trending music”)
      - Directly enter a TikTok sound link (e.g., `https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8hvBwCb/`)
    - **Content Type**: Select video or image.
    - **Add Sound Toggle**: Enable/disable adding sound.
    - **Upload Waiting Time**: Set delay after uploading (5–60 seconds) to ensure TikTok’s servers fully process the content before continuing.
    - **Add Product Link Toggle**: Enable/disable adding product links.
    - **Caption Format**: Choose between two caption formats:
      - **Multiline**: Each line is a separate caption. System rotates through them sequentially.
      - **Spintax**: Use `{option1|option2}` syntax for random text generation.
    - **Captions**: Enter captions based on the selected format (detailed below).
    - **Material Tags**: Filter materials by tag. If not set, all materials will be used.
5. Click **Start Script** to begin execution.

## Caption Formats

The system supports two caption formats to give you flexible control over your post captions.

### Multiline Mode (Default)

**How it works:**
- Each line represents one independent caption
- System uses captions in sequential order and loops back to the beginning
- Use `###` within a line to add line breaks inside a caption

**Example:**

```
First caption###with line break
Second caption###also with line break
Third caption without line break
```

**Platform-specific features:**
- **TikTok**: Use `##` to separate title and description (e.g., `Title##Long Description`)
- **Instagram**: `##` is not supported and will show a warning

### Spintax Mode

**How it works:**
- Only one caption template
- Use `{option1|option2|option3}` syntax for random variations
- Use **native line breaks** (press Enter key) for multi-line captions
- Do NOT use `###` - it won't be interpreted

**Example:**

```
{Today|Tomorrow|Yesterday} the weather is {good|great|awesome}
Welcome to follow my account##Click the link for more info
```

**Platform-specific features:**
- **TikTok**: `##` works to separate title and description
- **Instagram**: `##` is not supported

**Note:** In Spintax mode, if you see `###` in your caption, the system will suggest using native line breaks instead.

## Material Management

### Music Usage Modes

When the **Posting Method** is set to *Use Sound via Search*, the script supports two modes for adding music:

#### 1. Sound Search Mode

Enter a sound name to search inside TikTok:

- Examples: `original sound`, `trending music`, `viral beat`
- The script will search TikTok’s sound library and select the first matching result
- Best for trending/popular sounds

#### 2. Sound Link Mode

Enter a direct TikTok sound URL to use a specific sound:

- Supported link formats:
  - Short link: `https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8hvBwCb/`
  - Music page: `https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7473897776619834646`
  - VM link: `https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMhvBwCbD/`
- The script automatically detects links starting with `https://` and opens them directly
- Best for using specific sounds from specific videos

### Media Library

- **Material Tags**: Add tags to materials for filtering during publishing. If not specified, all materials are used.
- **Material Caption**: You can assign a custom caption to each material. If set, it overrides the publish settings.
- **Material Username**: You can assign a username to each material. Materials with matching usernames are prioritized.
- **Material Sorting**: Assign sorting numbers to materials (useful for multi-image posts). Lower numbers appear earlier.

### Local Folder Source

- **Folder Structure**:

  ```text
  /material-root/
  ├── caption.txt (optional - root fallback)
  ├── sound_names.txt (optional - root fallback)
  ├── sound_urls.txt (optional - root fallback)
  ├── @username1/
  │   ├── video1.mp4
  │   ├── video2.mp4
  │   ├── image1.jpg
  │   ├── image2.jpg
  │   ├── caption.txt (optional)
  │   ├── sound_names.txt (optional)
  │   └── sound_urls.txt (optional)
  ├── @username2/
  │   ├── content1.mp4
  │   ├── content2.jpg
  │   ├── caption.txt (optional)
  │   ├── sound_names.txt (optional)
  │   └── sound_urls.txt (optional)
  └── ...

  ````

- **Folder Path**: Specify the root path containing username subfolders.
- **Username Subfolders**: Each username must have its own subfolder (e.g., `@username1`, `@username2`).
- **Root Folder Fallback**: If a username folder does not exist or username is empty, materials and settings will be read from the root folder.
- **Supported Formats**:

  - Video: MP4
  - Image: JPG, PNG
- **Caption File**: An optional `caption.txt` per username folder for custom captions. Falls back to root `caption.txt` if not found.
  - **Format Support**: Caption.txt files automatically support both Multiline and Spintax formats:
    - **Multiline format**: Each line is a separate caption, rotates sequentially
    - **Spintax format**: Use `{option1|option2}` syntax for random variations
    - **Native line breaks**: Use Enter key for multi-line captions within Spintax
    - **Title/Description split**: Use `##` (TikTok only, not Instagram)
  - **No format declaration needed**: The content itself determines whether it's Multiline or Spintax
- **Music Files**:

  - **sound_names.txt**: Sound names for search, one per line. Reads in order and loops when reaching the end.
  - **sound_urls.txt**: TikTok sound URLs, one per line. Reads in order and loops when reaching the end.
  - If username folder does not exist, reads from root music files.
- **File Selection**:

  - Videos: randomly choose one each time
  - Images: select multiple depending on count
- **Usage Tracking**: Files are automatically marked as used to prevent repetition.

### Caption.txt File Format

When using **Local Folder Source**, the `caption.txt` file supports flexible caption formats with both sequential rotation and random text generation. This file can override the caption settings from the UI.

#### Multiline Format Example

Each line is a separate caption. The system rotates through them sequentially:

```text
Amazing video! Check it out! 🎥
Love this content! Don't miss it! ✨
Great post! Follow for more! 🔥
```

**With line breaks using ###:**

```text
First caption###with line break
Second caption###also supports###multiple line breaks
Third caption on single line
```

**With TikTok title/description split:**

```text
Amazing Discovery##Here's the full story about this incredible find!
Quick Tutorial##Step-by-step guide to master this technique
Daily Vlog##Join me on this exciting journey today
```

#### Spintax Format Example

Use `{option1|option2}` syntax for random text variations. Use native line breaks (press Enter):

```text
{Good morning|Hello|Hi}! Check out this {amazing|incredible|awesome} video!
{Follow for more|Like and share|Tag your friends}
```

Possible outputs:

- "Good morning! Check out this amazing video!"
- "Hello! Check out this incredible video!"
- "Hi! Check out this awesome video!"

**Complex Spintax with variations:**

```text
{🔥|✨|🎉} {Don't miss|Check out|Watch} this {amazing|incredible|awesome} {video|content|post}!
{Follow for more|Like and share|Tag your friends} {#trending|#viral|#fyp} #tiktok
```

**Spintax with TikTok title/description split:**

```text
{Exciting|Amazing|Incredible} {News|Update|Discovery}##Here's what you need to know about this {fantastic|wonderful|remarkable} {development|update|story}!
```

#### Complete Caption.txt Example

Combining multiple caption formats in one file:

```text
{Morning motivation|Daily inspiration|Start your day}! 💪

{Loving|Enjoying|Obsessed with} this {beautiful|amazing|stunning} view! 🌅

{Can't believe|So excited about|Thrilled with} this {moment|experience|adventure}! ✨

## FAQ

1. **Why does the task fail?**

   - Automation scripts simulate user actions based on TikTok/Instagram behaviors. Failures may occur due to network issues, app glitches, unexpected pop-ups, device performance issues, compatibility issues, etc.
   - If failures persist after retries, submit a support ticket.

2. **How can I run tasks unattended?**

   - Create a device group and set a schedule in the group's Post settings. The software will automatically create and run publishing tasks at the specified time every day.

3. **How to control the order of slideshow posts?**

   - Set sorting numbers for each image material in the media library. Lower numbers appear earlier.
   - You may also batch-import materials using filenames that follow this pattern:

     - `sort_1_description.png`
     - `sort_2_description.png`
     - `sort_3_description.png`

4. **How to use different materials, captions, and music for each account?**

   - With local folders: create subfolders for each username and add `caption.txt`, `sound_names.txt`, or `sound_urls.txt` files to define custom captions and music. The script prioritizes matching username folders.
   - With the media library: set username and caption fields for each material, and the script will prioritize matching materials.

5. **What material formats are supported?**

   - Video: MP4
   - Image: JPG, PNG

6. Can images and video materials be reused?

  No. To protect your accounts, our system automatically marks materials as used after they have been posted so they won't be selected again. This helps prevent duplicate posts and reduces the risk of account flags or bans.
